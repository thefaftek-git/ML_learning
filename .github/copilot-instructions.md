# Project Information
This is a machine learning project for generating 2D wireframe images. The model aims to learn from scratch without pre-provided training data and produce specific SVG wireframe images.

# Tools and Libraries
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for neural network implementation
- NumPy, Matplotlib for data handling and visualization
- SVG libraries for image generation/processing

# Code Guidelines
- Keep code well-documented for educational purposes
- Prioritize clarity over performance optimizations
- Include detailed comments explaining the ML concepts
